      <h2>Mapping Data Practices of (Potential) Data Intermediary Organisations in India</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The study consisted of semi-structured interviews with various non-governmental and non-commercial organisations in India, across sectors, who work with national-scale datasets created by government agencies. This table -- containing details about how these organisations access, use, and share data (understood as raw/disaggregated data) -- gives an overview of the existing data practices of potential data intermediaries in India.</p>
        <p>The detailed table of data practices can be <a href="http://bit.ly/ogd_india_mapping" target="_blank">accessed here</a>.
