      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>4.4. Key Themes - Right to Information and Open Data in India</h3>
      <p>This study only managed to scrape the surface of understanding how the Right to Information and open data agendas and communities are conversing, or not, in India. The general sense is that there exists interests on both the sides to engage in exchanges of of knowledge and collaborative initiatives, but such efforts are yet to take any visible shape. When asked if their organisation identifies itself more with the Right to Information groups or with the emerging open data community, the representatives interviewed in this study were found to side mostly with the former. The question was obviously not asked to quantitatively understand whether Right to Information groups or open data community have greater support among these organisations, but to bring forth why these organisations would decide to side with either communities. The people who mentioned that their organisation has more operational similarity with Right to Information groups gave the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Because open data community is yet to become substantial, and</li>
      <li>Because of the scale of the problems that the organisation engage with.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While the first reason can clearly shift the other way as the open data community expands in India, the second reason offers a great insight in the scalar difference in the data/information problems addressed by Right to Information and open data agendas, and can surely inspire future research on the topic.</p>
      <p>People who though that their organisations has more in common with the open data community provided the two following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Because the government data concerned is already available, and</li>
      <li>Because the organisation primarily works with available non-government data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These answers also are highly insightful as they reveal how practice-oriented the open data community is in India (and perhaps elsewhere too). Organisations who consider themselves close to the community are simply those that are working with a large-scale of open data, either created by government or non-government agencies.</p>
      <p>Sona Mitra of Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability [1] and Chakshu Roy of PRS Legislative Research [2] offered two opposite views of the relationship between Right to Information and open data agendas in India, which represent very well the range of views heard about the matter in the conversations during this study. According to Sona, Right to Information and open data agenda have a certain ideological convergence, in terms of arguing for institutionalisation of public disclosure of government data and information, but there is a divergence when it comes to practical concerns. Right to Information agenda, Sona noted, is interested in opening up more than simply data collected and produced as part of governmental processes. It is interested in enabling the citizens to have a clearer understanding of the functioning of the government itself, while data is one way of arriving at that understanding. Chakshu argued that the Right to Information and open data agendas in India are conceptually and practically different, in terms of how how the agendas are articulated and operationalised. He explained that while the Right to Information agenda is implemented in a “retail model,” where citizens have to go to the government and demand a piece (or a set) of information every time there is a need for the same, the emerging open data agenda in India is demanding a systemic change in management of government data.</p>
      <p>Either converging or diverging, the dynamics between Right to Information and open data agendas in India is also at the heart of the NDSAP. The policy document sets up a governance framework for proactive disclosure of data by Government of India by extending upon the general mandate of Right to Information as presented in the Act of 2005. On April 15, 2013, the Department of Personnel and Training circulated office memo specifying the guidelines for implementation of suo motu (that is, proactive) disclosure of information under the Right to Information Act [3]. The Section 4 of the RTI Act declared that proactive disclosure of government information must happen along with reactive disclosure, but  it did not specify how this aspect of the Act is to be operationalised. This memo made it mandatory for all government agencies to declare on the website a detailed inventory of all datasets managed by the agency concerned, with clarification regarding their publication status (open or closed), and to publicly and automatically share all the Right to Information requests received by the agency concerned and the respective responses sent out. This memo creates a great opportunity for close integration of NDSAP and Right to Information Act, especially since the memo is silent in describing the technical framework of content/data management system required for hosting and distributing the proactively published information, and this is an area where the NDSAP-PMU team has already had significant experience.</p>
