      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>3. Open Government Data Policy and Platform in India</h3>
      <p><strong>3.1. National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Since late 1990s, the Indian state has rapidly, though unevenly, moved towards extensive adoption of information and communication technologies to raise the quality and ease of state-citizen interactions. The “Report of the Working Group on Convergence and E-Governance for the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002-07)” gave an early call to arms for electronic governance initiatives that “involves transformation from being a passive information and service provider to active citizen involvement” [1]. While the Right to Information Act of 2005 created a reactive disclosure instrument for the citizens to realise their right to gather information about governmental activities, processes and their status, a crucial gap remained in terms of the citizen's ability to access government data in large scales and easily usable formats. This lacuna was addressed by the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) prepared by the Department of Science and Technology in 2012. This is the first policy in India that categorically deals with access to public data in machine-readable formats.</p>
      <p>During the 2010-11 India visit of Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, several collaborations between the Indian and the US governments were launched. One of such initiatives was the Open Government Platform – an open source data and content management system that can be customised easily to develop open data portals for various types of agencies, including national government. National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Government of India (henceforth, NIC) and Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies, General Services Administration, Government of USA, undertook a collaborative software development project to build the Open Government Platform in early 2011. It is to be noted that this software development project and drafting of the NDSAP proceeded side by side, and the requirements of one informed the contents of the other. As the text of the NDSAP document makes explicit, the dominant focus of the Policy is towards describing the desired functioning of the Open Government Data Platform of India – the URL of the same was specified in the Policy itself – as opposed to describing a government-wide re-engineering of data collection, management and publication practices towards opening up government data.</p>
      <p>The first draft version of the NDSAP document was published first on May 2011 along with a call for public responses. Although this may have attracted various feedbacks from different stakeholders, only the one submitted by The Centre for Internet and Society, Bengaluru, is publicly accessible (from its website) [2]. None of the suggestions from this submission, however, were reflected in the final version of the policy published in The Gazette of India on March 17, 2012. The policy declared that data produced, collected and collated by the government agencies using public funds should be made publicly available in an organised, well-documented and timely manner, so as to enable the use of such data to produce socio-democratic as well as economic value.</p>
      <p>The policy covers all ministries, departments, subordinate offices, organisations and autonomous bodies of the central government, and mandates that all “shareable” “non-sensitive” data should be published through a common government data portal deployed and managed by NIC. Here “shareable” refers to data declared to be such by the government agency that created it, and “non-sensitive” refers to data sharing of which is not prohibited by any central government acts.</p>
      <p>NDSAP further states that the published data must be available in both human-readable and machine-readable formats, adopt file and metadata standards as specified by NIC, and should be updated regularly. Though this policy was directly targeted at central government agencies, it was expected that equivalent state-level policies will be passed subsequently, which would facilitate open sharing of data across various tiers of the government.  While the policy upholds the principle of “openness,” in actuality it only enforces use of open standards for publication of data and not the simultaneous adoption of open licenses. Thus, strictly speaking, NDSAP cannot be called an open government data policy. Instead, it must be seen as the first step taken by the Indian government to consider born digital public data as a special category of government data, thus requiring a specific manner of its publication, and acceptance of the unique value of machine-readable datasets for effective citizenship.</p>
      <p>Moreover, an effective open government data policy must not only ensure re-usability of public sector information and open data standards to enable such reusability, but must also be integrated with various administrative programmes driven by and generating significant amounts of data about governmental processes. It needs to be formulated within specific national policy context, considering the varying administrative cultures and governance frameworks to collect, archive, process and make accessible digital traces of citizenship, statecraft and state-citizen interactions. NDSAP falls short of substantially opening up government data in this respect too, as it continues to lack the element of interdepartmental and cross-policy referencing to build a more robust and coherent programme of open government data and access.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>3.2. Open Government Data Platform of India</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Following the directive of NDSAP, NIC created the NDSAP-PMU (NDSAP Project Management Unit) in 2012 to build the Open Government Data Platform of India [3]. The first version of the Platform was launched in May 2012. It was powered by a thoroughly customised version of the above mentioned Open Government Platform software. Since then the NDSAP-PMU has interpreted its initial mandate of developing and managing the data portal to include various other critical roles such as enforcing adoption of “open standards” for published datasets, evangelising proactive sharing of government data across agencies through detailed consultation meetings, organising community outreach programmes to induce increased usage of the datasets available from the portal, etc. Informed by its consultations with various government agencies, non-government organisations and citizen groups, it prepared an implementation guidelines document that has already been through a few iterations [4]. This document details out the stages of the data contribution process, including the role and responsibilities of the Data Controllers, relevant metadata and file standards, and management of datasets after they have been published in the portal.</p>
      <p>The most recent version of the Platform was launched on February 18, 2014. The website is now powered by an upgraded Open Government Platform built on Drupal 7 [5] that implements API based public access to the datasets hosted in the platform. The Platform attempts to provide an unified catalog of data sets submitted to the Platform by various central government agencies. In most cases, the submitted data is hosted at and made available from the Platform itself, while in a few rare cases the Platform provides link to data actually hosted in the server of the data publishing agency. All central government agencies – Ministries and organisations within it – have chosen a Data Controller to drive and coordinate the data publication activities of the agency concerned. Numerous Data Contributors work within each such agency, led by the Data Controller, to submit data sets to the Platform through a web-based submission and scrutiny process. NDSAP-PMU is in the process of deliberating with various state governments in India about the possibility of launching state-level data portals powered by the Open Government Platform software, deployed in the Platform-as-a-Service model.</p>
      <p>This software allows users, both governmental and non-governmental, to browse the data catalog, view the metadata associated with each data set, comment on and rank various aspects of the data set, create basic visualisations by choosing variables from the dataset, download available data sets and submit request for those that are not available yet. Further, it has features such as for exporting of published data sets in various open formats (such as, CSV and XML) irrespective of the format of the original data sets. After initially using the Recline.js library [6], developed by Open Knowledge Foundation, for within-Platform visualisation of hosted data sets, it has recently launched a self-built visualisation engine [7]. This engine allows visualisation of hosted data sets as linkable and embeddable charts, and can also be used to create menu-driven visualisations of data sets supplied by the user.</p>
