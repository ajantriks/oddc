      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>2.3. Methodology - Identifying Organisations</h3>
      <p>As discussed above, this study has not been limited only to organisations that purely function as “data intermediary organisations” but interacted with a wider range of organisations that perform that task of mediating access to data and information and enabling its usage by other organisations. Many of the organisations (interacted with in the study) perform multiple data-related functions such as creating data, using data to inform intra-organisational activities, sharing data with other organisations and citizens in general, training other organisations and individuals to use (collect, analyse, etc.) data, etc. A few of the organisations considered in the study do not share data with other organisations at the present, but have the potential – in terms of willingness and capacity – to do so. As the study was not interested in assessing and identifying the organisations in India that function as “data intermediary organisations” but in understanding the existing range of practices of accessing, using, and re-sharing national-scale government data in India, it was crucial to consider a selected set of organisations that differ in their sectoral focus, strategy and theory of change, technological capacities and geographic location. That being said, these organisations were needed to be involved in working with national-scale government data sets and in publishing them for public usage – with or without restrictions – not only as information but also as data.</p>
      <p>To decide upon the initial set of organisations to begin the study with – as it was expected that snowball sampling will be most useful to identify the entire set of organisations to be considered in this study – an Internet-based survey was launched on June 25, 2013 [1]. In this survey, representatives of organisations that work with significant amount of government data were invited to submit the following information:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Details about the respondent and the organisation concerned,</li>
      <li>Whether the organisation identify itself as functioning as “data/information intermediary,”</li>
      <li>Details about how the organisation works with data and/or information,</li>
      <li>Whether the organisation would like to be interviewed for this study, and</li>
      <li>Whether there are other “data intermediary organisations” known by the respondent who should be considered in this study.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Link to this survey was shared through various mailing lists and professional networks in India that are related to questions of data, open data, and development. However, it attracted very few responses and not the most useful ones. There were five organisations that completed this survey: Enthought Inc., Fields of View, Indian Institute of Human Settlements, Karnataka Learning Partnership, and Niti Digital. While Enthought Inc. and Niti Digital are commercial organisations that substantially work with data to produce analytics, visualisations, reports, and services, they do not publish the same data in re-usable formats. Fields of View and Indian Institute of Human Settlements are research and advocacy organisations that are also involved in strong data-driven research activities but neither do they undertake significant re-sharing of the data they work with. Interestingly, it is Gautam John of Karnataka Learning Partnership, which is one of the most important “data intermediary organisations” in India, who also suggested names of other organisations that this study can potentially survey.  The experience of this survey suggested that the most effective way to proceed with this study would be to start speaking to organisations, such as Karnataka Learning Partnership, that are most well-known within the open data circuit in India and follow the references to other organisations offered by them.</p>
      <p>Two more decisions were taken at this point. Firstly, the initial Internet-based survey and online/offline searches did not reveal any commercial organisation in India that accesses, uses, and re-shares (as opposed to re-selling) government data. Hence the focus of the study was narrowed down to non-governmental research and advocacy organisations. Secondly, the five national information/knowledge portals of India – India Biodiversity Portal run by Strand Life Sciences [2], India Energy Portal run by The Energy Research Institute [3], India Environmental Portal run by Centre for Science and Environment [4], India Urban Portal run by National Institute of Urban Affairs [5], and India Water Portal run by Arghyam [6] – were automatically selected for consideration in this study, since they already play a critical role in aggregating, archiving and sharing large sector-specific bodies of information and have a great potential to also host and share government and non-government data related to the sectoral issues (if they are not doing it already).</p>
      <p>The methodological decisions mentioned above clearly creates a possibility of introducing subjective bias in the selection of organisations to be studied. To counterweight this, all the organisations interacted with during the study were asked to suggest names of other organisations that should also be addressed by the study. Answers to this question largely generated references back to organisations that have already been (or planned to be) interacted with, and thus validated the inclusion of the organisations concerned.  The study comprised of engagements with fourteen organisations, located across Bengaluru (three organisations), Chennai (one organisation), Delhi (nine organisations), and Hyderabad (one organisation). There is an explicit dominance of organisations from Delhi here, primarily due to the concentration of research and advocacy organisations in the capital. Survey of five organisations from three cities in southern part of India partially balance the overall bias towards organisations from Delhi, that is north India. In terms of thematic focus, the surveyed organisations work across the following sectors: budget and governance expenditure (two organisations), education (two organisations), electoral and parliamentary transparency (two organisations), environment (five organisations), and urban development (three organisations). In terms of sectoral involvements, the set of organisations included in this study are thus quite diverse and help government data insights to be brough together from across these sectors. For lack of time, a small number of organisations were initially considered but finally not included in the study, such as Bangalore Urban Metabolism Project, Digital Green, and Praja Foundation.</p>
