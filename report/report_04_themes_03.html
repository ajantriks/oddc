      <h1>Opening Government Data through Mediation:<br />Exploring Roles, Practices and Strategies of (Potential) Data Intermediary Organisations in India</h1>

      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>4.3. Key Themes - Sharing Government Data</h3>
      <p>Majority of the organisations interacted with in this study share government data in the form of various data products – analytical briefs, detailed reports, infographics for print media, online visualisations, and printed materials shared with various audience groups. However, very few of these organisations also share the sanitised and reorganised version of the data (done by the agency concerned) in disaggregated form. For organisations working in certain sectors, such as analysis of budget and governance expenditure data, re-sharing of data is much lesser a concern since the original data (published by government) is often available in a directly usable format, and the challenging task is not sanitisation of data but its analysis. Conversely, organisations working in sectors where official data is produced by multiple government agencies and are not published in an uniform and easily-accessible manner, such as India Water Portal and Karnataka Learning Partnership, it becomes crucial to not only share the analytical findings from the government data but also the collated and sanitised data itself. Again for organisations like ASER Centre and India Biodiversity Portal – that respectively collect and share data on quality of primary education and various government schemes, and locational and taxonomic data about flora and fauna – data sharing is part of their core activities, since the government itself produce little or no (publicly available) data on these topics. Organisations whose work involve collection of substantial amount of narrative and information responses from the government through Right to Information requests – such as Accountability Initiative and Transparent Chennai – face great technical hurdles in re-sharing such information and data in accessible digital formats, as those responses are usually provided in printed format. These organisations sometimes scan and upload entire paper documents for public access but this is clearly not the most desirable solution.</p>
      <p>Though the Election Commission of India make public the affidavit documents – containing information on social, economic, and criminal records – of the political candidates submitted before election, Association for Democratic Reforms plays a fundamental role in converting the scanned PDF copies of those affidavits (originally submitted as paper documents) into actually usable data. It is, however, troubling that a few organisations – such as Association for Democratic Reforms and ASER Centre – who undertake a significant self-collection of data, and or liberation of data from available-but-closed government documents, decide to not publicly share the final data (collected or liberated) in disaggregated form. Both these organisations raise concerns regarding the capacities and motivations of potential users of the disaggregated data as their primary reason for not sharing the data. They do consider and undertake sharing of such data directly with mostly academic researchers, but only customised data reports and analyses are shared with local and regional outreach and intervention partners. Two other reasons often given by some of the organisations that tend to not re-share, or partially re-share, the raw re-organised data are that (a) they do not experience demand from disaggregated data (as opposed to data reports) from from researchers, media persons, and other individuals and organisations, and hence do not invest organisational time sharing it, and (b) the lack of an organisational history of re-sharing data leads to a by-default not sharing of the same, or sharing of the same in aggregated or closed formats.</p>
      <p>In this context, Karnataka Learning Partnership is clearly one of the leaders among open government data intermediary organisations in India. It not only gathers various types of data produced by multiple government and non-government agencies, it re-shares them across various kinds of data products ranging from downloadable dumps of the disaggregated data, online map-based data browsing interface, to printed report cards created specifically for various stakeholder groups. The India Biodiversity Portal must also be mentioned here for establishing a most remarkable archiving and re-sharing facility for ecological data created by a multitude of non-government sources. Facing a great difficulty in gathering data from official/governmental sources regarding biodiversity in India, the Portal, led by researchers from Strand Life Sciences [1] and Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment [2], began collecting spatial and taxonomic data about habitation of species – flora and fauna – across India. It works with a range of partner (civil society) organisations and crowd-sources data through citizen science initiatives such as MigrantWatch [3]. While the Portal was recognised by the National Knowledge Commission as one of the five national knowledge portals, it has functioned almost fully without financial or operational support from the government. Unfortunately, it has neither been able to induce a positive response from the government in terms of opening up government data about the topics relevant. The government has established a similar initiative called the Indian Biodiversity Information System (IBIS) [4] – led by the Institute of Agricultural Science, Bangalore and National Remote Sensing Authority – which has neither opened up their biodiversity datasets. This highlights the difficulties of non-government efforts to aggregate and re-share open data at the face of governmental indifference, and especially the productive role sector-specific data disclosure policies must play to complement and empower such citizen/researcher-driven efforts.</p>
      <p>Suman Bhattacharjea of ASER Centre narrated how lack of data skills and capacities of researchers and activists at large has driven ASER Centre to design courses of varying duration suitable for different kinds of organisations. These courses consisting lessons in arithmetics, statistics, collecting and analysing data, and making decisions based upon that; and are offered to government agencies at sub-district level, district-level colleges and regional universities, field-level non-government organisations, etc. Suman explained that such kinds of capacity building efforts are critical not only to ensure effective and sustained re-usage of the data collected and shared by ASER Centre, but also to work towards a wider culture of data/evidence-based planning and decision-making within government and non-government agencies alike. Kiran Pandey of India Environment Portal suggested that existing linkages that organisations like Centre for Science and Environment has, on one hand, with government officials who produce and manage production of data, and with field-level non-government organisations, on the other, can be strategically used to strengthen and integrate the open data agenda on both the data production and consumption side. Effective and productive sharing of government data requires both publication of reliable and regularly updated data, and capacity building of potential re-users of data. Kiran argued that collaborative efforts among government agencies and intermediary organisations are vital. For example, Centre for Science and Environment organises training sessions on managing data, among other topics, for resource regulation (government) agencies and also for non-government organisations working in similar sectors. These training sessions can be very valuable sites of collaboration with the NDSAP-PMU team so that the workshop participants coming from both government agencies and non-government organisations can be introduced to the idea of open data, and also to the specific data sharing procedures and standards implemented by the Open Government Data Platform of India. Workshops like these can also be useful to encourage and train non-government organisations to open up data sets collected by them, using data standards comparable with the Platform.</p>
      <p>It is crucial to note here that the organisations surveyed in this study only consider legal concerns as a factor preventing data re-sharing when the data has been bought from one of the government agencies (or from a commercial re-seller of government data), but not if the data was downloaded from a government website. Data available in the Internet is automatically considered to be “open” – not only for use, but also for re-sharing. The organisations are very much aware that these data sets (available on the Internet) often come with no or vague license details but do not consider that as a problem in actuality. Importantly, data and information collected through Right to Information requests, or shared through the Open Government Data Platform (that is under NDSAP), or taken from government websites are all popularly seen as open data and information, irrespective of their potentially different legal status and licenses. It is also to be noted that several high-value datasets created by government agencies are sold as data products – such as rainfall data, physical and political maps, and Census data. It is not at all clear at what levels of aggregation the re-sharing of such data is allowed by the agencies concerned, and under general legal guidelines for government data in India.</p>
