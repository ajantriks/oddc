      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy [1] (henceforth, NDSAP) was approved by the Government of India in early 2012 to encourage and govern publication of government created and owned datasets, from various agencies of the central government of India, in open digital formats and through a single national data portal. The Policy extended the mandate of the Right to Information Act of 2005 [2] by establishing the principles and procedures of proactive disclosure of government data in India. The national data portal of India, or the Open Government Data Platform of India [3], was launched later in 2012 to start collecting and publishing open government data. The NDSAP Project Management Unit (henceforth, NDSAP-PMU), within National Informatics Centre, was entrusted with development, deployment, and management of the Platform and popularising publication and usage of open government data. Over the last years the NDSAP-PMU has organised several outreach events, workshops and competitions, often in collaboration with different industrial and academic bodies, towards these goals.</p>
      <p>The open government data agenda and its implementation in India, however, remains still too young to make possible a study of its outcomes and impacts. This study, hence, explores not the outcomes of the NDSAP or the Open Government Data Platform of India as such, but the existing practices of accessing and using government data in India to understand what challenges this Policy and its implementations should respond to, and what available opportunities can be mobilised towards an effective open data agenda.</p>
      <p>Beginning in May 2013 as part of the 'Exploring the Emerging Impacts of Open Data in Developing Countries' (ODDC) research network managed by the World Wide Web Foundation and supported by the International Development Research Centre, Canada, this study was initially conceptualised by the author and Zainab Bawa of HasGeek Media LLP as a comparative study of organisations working with urban data in India. The proposed project originally planned to locate these policy documents, especially NDSAP, in the context of their actual implications and uses for non-government data practitioners. We wanted to focus on non-government advocacy and research organisations working in the area of urban development across five cities in India –Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai and Pune – and to map their practices of collecting, accessing, sharing and using government and self-generated urban data, such as those related to property records, geo-spatial data, sanitation and public health, elected representatives etc. The two key questions for the study were: (1) how RTI and NDSAP have transformed approaches and processes of data practices, and (2) can the grounded experience of advocacy and research organisations inform shaping of a more effective and open data policy for India?</p>
      <p>However, two principal factors compelled us to rethink the approach of the study. Firstly, our initial discussions with policy researchers, RTI activists, and open data activists revealed possibility of curious disjunction between the open data and the Right to Information movements in India. This is especially interesting in our specific policy context where the NDSAP document gets developed as an extension of the RTI act. Given this early finding, we were keen to revisit our first research question (mentioned above) and to categorically explore the experiences of accessing government data by various organisations in India, to specifically highlight out the relative uses of (or not) of the RTI act and the NDSAP for this purpose. Secondly, the subject area of urban development was originally chosen to systematically focus the scope of the study, as well as to chose a specific governance context to gather more precise insights. Our initial discussions with policy researchers, open data activists and RTI activists indicated that by limiting the study to a certain subject area, we might be losing out on interacting with organisations that are key actors in the domain of accessing government information and data in India.</p>
      <p>For example, Arghyam [4] works on issues of water and sanitation and is at the forefront of accessing, using and opening up water related government data for further uses; Karnataka Learning Partnership [5] focuses on primary education challenges in Karnataka (a southern state of India) and gathers substantial primary data to analyse performance in primary schools across the state; and Association for Democratic Reforms [6] is singularly responsible for ensuring public sharing of affidavits (including data on social, economic, and criminal records) submitted by political candidates before participating in elections. We were of the opinion that these non-government organisations, of diverse sectoral foci, must be engaged with to have a more robust understanding of how government data and information is being accessed, used and opened up in India.</p>
      <p>The reformulated study, hence, decided to discard the thematic focus in selection of  organisations to be studied, and to look into organisations that access, use, and share national level (since NDSAP is a national level, and not a state level policy) government data. It focused on exploring the actual practices around government data by various (non-governmental) “data intermediary organisations” on one hand, and implementation challenges faced by managers of the Open Government Data Platform of India on the other, so as to identify possible areas of policy modification, capacity building, community organisation, and alignment of efforts.</p>
      <p>The study has the following objectives:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>To undertake a provisional mapping of government data related activities across different sectors to understand the nature of the “open data community” in India,</li>
      <li>To enrich government data/information policy discussion in India by gathering evidence and experience of (non-governmental) data intermediaries regarding their actual practices of accessing and sharing government data, and their utilisation of the provisions of NDSAP and RTI act, and</li>
      <li>To critically reflect on the nature of open data practices in India.</li>
      </ul>
