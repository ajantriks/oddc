      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
      <p>To repeat the above mentioned methodological clarification, this was not an effort to locate the “data intermediary organisations” in India but to survey a selected a cross-sector set of non-governmental and non-commercial organisations that enable other organisations to better work with (access, use, and share) government and non-government data, and see what opportunities and challenges they experience in (inter)mediating access and use of data and information. The study involved speaking to the representatives of these organisations and understanding their actual practices of accessing, using, and re-sharing data – primarily data published by government, but also self-collected data and those produce by non-government organisations. Three other key issues that emerged during the course of the discussions are: (1) the nature of the “open data community” in India and the participation of the organisation concerned in the same, (2) the many challenges of effectively opening up government data in India, and (3) the implications, applications, and communities around the Right to Information Act, and the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy. While this study could analyse the first two of these issues, the last one remains to be explored in details.</p>
      <p>The study foregrounds three critical characteristics of the practices of accessing, using, and sharing government and non-government data in India. Firstly, the term “open government data” (or “open data” in general) is not commonly used among most of the organisations in India that work with national-scale government data. Meaning of the term is generally understood as data that is publicly available, either from government websites or from government publications, without a very strict notion of the legal status (such as, licensed for re-use and re-sharing or not) or technical qualities (such as, machine-readable or not) of the data concerned. This, however, is not to be interpreted as indicative of the limited engagements with government data by these organisations. In a generally data-scarce situation – that is, a situation where scarcity of publicly available government data is more the norm than the exception – these organisations (some of which have been surveyed in this study) not only significantly use government data, but undertake a range of data practices to liberate government data from non-machine-readable reports and information sheets, to sanitise and compiles government data sets available from different sources and not-directly-comparable forms, to make sense of under-documented government data through carrying out interviews with field-level government officials and others, etc. It is in this context that one should understand the expansive use of the term “open government data” in India, where any publicly available government data is seen, consumed and re-used as “open data” for all practical purposes.</p>
      <p>Secondly, same kind of challenges exist within government and non-government agencies when it comes to re-sharing government data. The key problem faced by both these categories of agencies is that they have come to treat data as a product and not as a process. For government agencies, data is part of the internal reporting and communication processes vis-a-vis other government agencies or the higher offices of the same government agency. Government data is thus often produced as a response to, and as rendered necessary by, the demands of such inter-agency and intra-agency communications and bureaucratic negotiations. Similarly for non-government organisations, data is often part of the reporting and communication processes vis-a-vis the donors that fund the activities of the organisation concerned. The entire life-cycle of data within these non-government organisations are hence determined by the demands of project monitoring and evidence gathering as defined by the donor organisations. Further, this approach to data as a product implies that both these categories of agencies see collected and produced data as something that once shared would either become less valuable for the agency concerned (since other agencies will extract the value out of it), or would be used to study and criticise the activities of the agency concerned. Also, internal and/or closed circulation of the data sets lead to insufficient documentation of data collection and analysis procedures as those are intended to be used only within a predefined set of users. This makes the data difficult to interpret even if it is opened up. A critical challenge for the open data agenda and community in India, hence, is to establish open data practices as an integral process of functioning of these government and non-government agencies. Such re-engineering of data practices towards treating collected data as a continuous and shared resource for better internal and external monitoring of activities, recording of evidences, and gathering of feedbacks will not only require demand for more open data from potential re-users, but also government-wide reforms and incentive structures, and strategic interventions from donor organisations.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, another key barrier for the open data agenda in India is the lack of organised and publicly articulated demand for open (disaggregated, updated, and anonymised) government and non-government data. While several organisations surveyed in the study enjoy a close and trusted working relationship with government agencies that allows them to easily access data held by these agencies, uncertainty regarding motivations and capacities of working with data was often mentioned as a key reason for not sharing data by both government and non-government organisations. The person-to-person relationships between data producing agencies and potential re-users, thus, critically mediate flow of both government and non-government data. Such relationships can facilitate opening up of data bypassing the formal procedures, but may also become bottlenecks. The challenge, hence, is to organise data users interested in accessing data created and shared by both government and non-government organisations. Unless such forums are being organised, perhaps through the efforts of an “open data community,” the various users of open government data will continue to face the current challenges: (a) lack of a common platform for discussing data availability, (b) severe standards, documentations and quality problems with government data, (c) almost complete unavailability of data produced by non-government organisations, including academic, advocacy and commercial agencies, (d) lack of augmentation of government-published data through sharing of value-added disaggregated data by non-governmental organisations; and (e) lack of an understanding of mutual data needs and competences that continue to reinforce the existing divides between government and non-government organisations. Consolidating the varied data demands of such organisations, identifying sector-specific standards and practices of collecting and sharing data, connecting the organisations that can potentially collaborate and/or learn from each other's abilities, and actively overseeing the implementation of the NDSAP are, hence, some of the key functions that the open data community in India can take responsibility for.</p>
