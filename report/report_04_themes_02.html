      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>4.2. Key Themes - Accessing Government Data</h3>
      <p>Organisations surveyed in this study typically access government data through websites of various government agencies, by directly requesting them from the government offices, or by submitting Right to Information requests. Although downloading of data sets from government websites is a very common practice, almost none of the organisations mentioned downloading of data from the Open Government Data Platform. A key reason for this is that since these organisations have been collecting data on particular topics for a long period, they are most comfortable downloading such data from their original creator's website (say, budget data from Ministry of Finance [1], and rainfall data from India Meteorological Department [2] website). Publicly available government data come most often in closed formats (that is, PDF files and HTML tables), which an important barrier to converting downloaded data into usable data, especially for time-critical exercises. For example, Association for Democratic Reforms, which collects, compiles and analyses personal and financial information declared by electoral candidates (at municipal, state, and national levels), rely on a large data entry team to convert PDF files (for each candidate) shared by the Election Commission of India [3] into an usable dataset. Certain Ministries, especially those that have a long tradition of publishing data for analysis by external researchers, such as the Planning Commission or Reserve Bank of India, make almost all of their data available online in open formats.</p>
      <p>Transparent Chennai [4], which often accesses government data through RTI requests, mostly receive requested data in printed format. In very few cases, interestingly, they have also received data sets over e-mail and in open formats. Collecting data sets directly from government offices is also a common practice, especially for organisations working with state- and local-level government agencies. Such data can come in both digital formats and hard copies. While collecting the data directly from the government offices, a few organisations mentioned that it is possible to copy the data from the computers of the agency concerned (that is, in machine-readable format) directly into USB drives or CDs. This, however, is not a general practice and is greatly dependent on the prior working relationship between the government office and the data-seeking agency concerned. Several organisations – such as Karnataka Learning Partnership [5], India Water Portal, and Transparent Chennai – reported that building long-term working relationships and trust with government agencies is fundamental to get access to these data sets. In several cases, such relationships become productive for both government agencies and non-government organisations, as the former makes certain data sets easily accessible for the latter, which in return offers data-based analyses and insights to the former, thus reinforcing mutual trust.</p>
      <p>Satyarupa Shekhar of Transparent Chennai explained that it is not only crucial to build trust when working closely with government agencies, but also to ensure that capacity of government officials are developed in the process and that the practical knowledge of these officials are brought out and converted into re-usable data. For example, while mapping public toilets in the city of Chennai, Transparent Chennai team invited a group of junior engineers working at the municipal authority to approximately point out the locations of the toilet mentioned on the official list. This rough map was then validated by volunteers who visited each location, verified it, and added further information about the public toilet units. Further, Satyarupa pointed out that it is very important to recognise and appropriately use/share certain data sets that may contain sensitive data from the perspective of the government. It is possible that the data is collected by the government to identify its own infrastructural lacks so as to better design a remedial intervention. Public sharing of such data, however, may lead to mostly non-productive criticisms of the government, without understanding that the data was collected in the first place so that the issue can be addressed (by the government). Gautam John of Karnataka Learning Partnership also referred to this fear of government officials that if opened up, data will be as “sticks” to criticise their activities. Given such a context, Satyarupa suggested that the intermediary organisation must ensure that the government agencies it is working with have a clear idea of the potential usages of the shared data, and that the former will not produce analyses and other usages of that data that shows the government agencies in poor light, or attracts non-constructive criticism.</p>
      <p>Conversely, organisations like the ASER Centre face another kind of problem as government agencies do not collect certain data sets to begin with (such as, qualitative data for primary education). This necessitates ASER Centre to undertake collection of primary data by itself. P.K. Bhattacharya of The Energy and Resources Institute also highlighted the problem of lacking regularity and completeness of government data. Overall there is a general feeling that the government has failed to revise and expand its statistical machinery, especially in the face of new technologies of collecting and managing data and increasing demand for government data from policy researchers and development practitioners. Several organisations interacted with in this study are actively involved in bridging such data gaps – either through collection of primary data, or collating data sets from various (public and private) sources, or sanitising data published by government agencies, or sharing analysed data with media houses and citizens' groups. Not all such organisations, however, embrace the open data agenda fully and adopt a wait-and-watch stance towards it. This is creating insufficiency and sectoral-imbalance in demand for open government data from the non-governmental sphere, as well as reducing mediated access (through re-sharing) to open government data.</p>
