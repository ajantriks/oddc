      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>4.5. Key Themes - Challenges in Opening Up Government Data in India</h3>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, most organisations mentioned that the foremost problem to be solved to make government data accessible is making the data sets available online. While growth of the number of data sets hosted by Open Government Data Platform has been very impressive, these data sets offer very little granularity, as most of them contain state-level and/or annual aggregates (with a few important exceptions, such as the daily price of agriculture produces across main wholesale markets across India [1]). A great wealth of data gathered by government agencies in India, however, is not only unavailable on the Platform but, more crucially, is not made publicly accessible (either commercially or otherwise) in digital formats at all. This challenge emanates from the very data/ information reporting structure between local, state and central government agencies.</p>
      <p>Many of such unpublished data sets are not kept out of public circulation due to any specific characteristics of the data itself, such as the data having personally identifiable information, or the data containing potentially sensitive information (from perspectives of either national security or social harmony). The prevailing reason for the non-publication of such data is often a simple lack of precedence of that data being shared by the government agency, or lack of confidence of the agency regarding the motivation of a non-government organisation or individual's interest in accessing that data. In a detailed survey among various central government agencies, Neeta Verma and M.P. Gupta have listed a set of six key challenges that these organisations are facing when attempting opening up and sharing of data [2]. These challenges included (a) the lack of clarity regarding the benefits (for government agencies) of opening up data, which leads to low motivation to do so, (b) insufficient capacity (human and financial) and budgetary support to streamline processes of collection, management and sharing of data, and (c) pending institutionalisation of open data within the everyday and regular activities of the government. The discussions with representatives of various organsiations in this study made it clear that what lies at the heart of these challenges within government is also the same thing that undermines an open data culture in the non-government sector – an approach to data as an end, and not as a mean to various ends.</p>
      <p>Anecdotes from Amitangshu Acharya and Isha Parihar of Akvo, Debjani Ghosh of National Institute of Urban Affairs, and  P.K. Bhattacharya of The Energy and Resources Institute illustrate how government agencies, especially the local authorities, look at data as part of the reporting procedure to agencies higher up in the bureaucratic order. Data is often produced not so much to reveal the ground realities but to resolve and negotiate inter-agency and intra-agency conflicts and interests. Further, such data exists in a deeply internally referenced manner, which makes its interpretation very difficult for anyone from outside the agency in particular, or the service delivery vertical in general. Lack of standardised database related procedures and of proper documentation, as highlighted by Gautam John of Karnataka Learning Partnership, makes this process of makings sense of disaggregated government data very time and expertise sensitive. The study suggest two potential strategies to initiate transformation towards re-engineering of internal data practices by government: (a) beginning internal usage of collected data within government agencies from the bottom-most bureaucratic levels, and (b) creating forums for direct interactions between government agencies that collect and manage data, and non-governmental organisations and individuals that would use such data.</p>
      <p>The first strategy leads to treatment of government data by its original creators as something that is directly beneficial to the creator's own activities, and not only as things to share with higher-order agencies.  Many problems with government data shared during the interviews reveal a systemic lack of capacity of higher-level agencies to ensure quality of data generated by lower-level agencies, and lack of motivation for lower-level agencies to produce reliable data. Self-usage of collected data, that is usage of data to drive internal activities, is expected to incentivise self-correction of sub-optimal and mis-guided data collection practices at all levels of the government, especially the field offices. Accountability of such data-driven governmental activities, of course, must be ensured through opening up the data for public scrutiny. Further, the Management Information Systems used by government agencies to archive government data are designed for storage and generation of aggregated reports, and not for sharing the data in anonymised form. As the government agencies often do not work with anonymised disaggregated data themselves, it becomes challenging for them to share it. As NDSAP-PMU experienced, much of the information systems used by the agencies are not built for publication of data, which necessitates a human layer for deciding, scrutinising, anonymising and submitting every set of data coming to the Open Government Data Platform.</p>
      <p>The second strategy involves generating structured and regular interactive forums for the government agencies that produce and share data to understand and respond to data needs of non-government organisations (including commercial ones) and opportunities and risks associated with that. The lack of interactions between government agencies and non-government users lead to misunderstandings between the two, in terms of their respective motivations and activities. As the experiences of Association for Democratic Reforms, Karnataka Learning Partnership and Transparent Chennai exemplify, a long-term relationship with government agencies can produce very effective models for data sharing. As the government agencies begin to benefit from the data analysis and information distribution undertaken by non-government re-users of data, the former are motivated to share data more easily, more regularly, and in greater quantity. Involving non-government organisations in analysing data coming out of ongoing government activities and using that to identify critical issues that require immediate attention may also help overcome the capacity shortfall (in short-run) within the government sphere to undertake data-driven policy implementation, and will also support wider creation of culture and skills in using data to engage with practical problems of governance. The potential threat created by such agency-to-agency channels of opening up government data, however, is that the actors on both sides of that relationship automatically gain a “gatekeeper” status, even if the organisation consciously avoids acting upon such priviledges. It must be noted that the lack of direct interactions with potential re-users of data impedes data sharing practices of non-governmental organisations, as mentioned above, as much as those of government agencies. The critical need, hence, is then to organise forums for interactions between data producers and data users – where both the sides can include both government and non-government agencies.</p>
      <p>A key finding of the study was that most of the organisations surveyed here understand the term “open data” as publicly available government data, most often through the websites of government agencies, without any specific technical (that is, PDF is also understood as open) or legal (that is, data without clear licensing details) understanding. This not only implies that the open data agenda needs to go deeper and wider among the research and advocacy organisations working with national-scale government data in India, but also reflects the present state of understanding and utilisation of “data” within the same circuit. The long experience of working with closed government data has perhaps brought down the general level of expectation when it comes to accessing, using and sharing government data. K. Srinivasalu of Association for Democratic Reforms stated it clearly that he does not mind when the Election Commission of India published affidavits of political candidates as scanned copy of paper documents turned into PDF files, and in fact finds it not “fair” to ask Election Commission of India to ensure publication of the same in machine-readable format. Given the key need for cost-benefit analysis, as highlighted here, when talking about upgrading the data reporting systems in a resource constrained situation like in India, it doubly becomes important that the open data agenda is not formulated as a stand alone project of the government, but as an integral part of the overall administrative and electronic governance reforms towards more open government practices.</p>
      <p>Finally, another crucial concern was voiced in several interviews during this study. Many of the organisations working with national-scale government data are largely populated by researchers coming from social science disciplines and they are mostly trained in statistical and econometric methods for working with such data. The programming-biased conversations both within open data community meetings and in events and outreach initiatives launched by the NDSAP-PMU tend to marginalise those researchers not trained to approach data questions in terms of JSON files [3] and APIs [4]. The same people who cited this reason – too much programming terms – for their organisations being in the sidelines of the open data community meetings have always stated better skills for data analysis and visualisation as the highest priority requirement for the organisation to raise their ability to access, use, share, and communicate data and information. These organisations, thus, recognise it very well that programming skills, and those of visualisation softwares, are becoming barriers for them to participate in both conversations around (open) government data and in effectively utilising the same data. Hence, creating avenues for development of skill of existing researchers and policy advocates, and employing or collaborating with those from complementary knowledge backgrounds – such as programmers specialising in working with data, and GIS experts – are gradually becoming commonplace in India. This is a greatly heartening trend but its institutionalisation is also crucial. While data skills must find its way into syllabus of social science, public policy and research courses, concerns about public implications of data must also be integrated into programming, statistics and technical courses.</p>
