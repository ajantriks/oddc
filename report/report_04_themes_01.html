      <h2>Project Report</h2>
      <h3>4.1. Key Themes - Open Data Community in India</h3>
      <p>One of the earliest events that brought together people talking about, or perhaps wondering about, open data in India was the barcamp on “Technology, Transparency and Accountability” organised by Accountability Initiative [1], Centre for Policy Research, on June 05, 2011 in Gurgaon [2]. The event was critical in bringing together more experienced information activists, especially those connected with the Right to Information movement, and relatively newer participants in transparency and accountability discussions in India, especially those who brought in a substantially technology-oriented approach. Several participants of this barcamp have since played important roles in the making of the open data agenda and practices in India. However, the interactions among the Right to Information activists and groups in India with those working with open data are yet to be become significant.</p>
      <p>One of the key questions for this study was to understand the shape and the dynamics of “open data community” in India. Although majority of respondents recognised that a particular network – DataMeet [3] – or specific persons associated with the network as the people who are driving the open data conversations in India, they also noted that their organisations consider themselves to be on the “sidelines” of this “open data community.” Two reasons were commonly offered for such an identification:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The kinds of government data that the organisation works with are already publicly available, though not necessarily in open format, and hence the organisation do not feel the need be involved in the “open data community” in a rigorous way, and</li>
      <li>The kinds of data that the organisation work with are not collected by the government at all, and hence it does not spend any organisational resources to push the government towards proactive disclosure of data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above reasonings, however, do not imply that these organisations are not interested in the open data agenda. On the contrary, all of these organisations that considered themselves to be on the fringes of the “open data community” explicitly stated that they consider open government data to be a necessary (although not sufficient) resource for ensuring greater transparency in governmental activities. Given limited organisational resources, however, most of the organisations surveyed here do no undertake more involved roles within the “open data community,” as they mostly work with data that is already publicly available, or with data not collected by the government at all. Further, it is of great interest that all organisations surveyed in this study considered themselves either as part of the “open data community” in India, or natural (or “by default”) allies of the same. This also reflects a sense of ambiguity regarding the very conditions of belonging to this “open data community.” Anticipating such a situation,this study did not employ any fixed determinants of belonging but depended on self-identification by the organisations. Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Lab [4] noted that, although, the commercial re-users of government data and the transparency and accountability activism interests have converged in North American and European countries to shape the “open data agenda,” which is yet to be the reality in India. Neither the commercial re-users of government data have organised itself to articulate a clear demand for open data practices by the government, nor have large-scale data-driven monitoring (by non-government agencies) of transparency and accountability of government activities become commonplace. It is this condition that creates the lack of clear understanding about what it means to belong to “open data community” in India.</p>
      <p>As Yamini Aiyar of Accountability Initiative explained, the “open data culture” in India is not only in its infancy but is mostly limited to a group of people who speak a certain vocabulary. This concern about the specific vocabulary, and technical knowledge and skills that go with it, of the people talking about open data has been flagged by several people interviewed in this study. This concern is heightened by the fact that though the open data agenda speaks a language that overlaps with related discourses of transparency and accountability on one hand, and evidence-driven developmental interventions on the other, it also deploys a precise technical understanding of digital data and its specific forms that enable easy programmatic manipulations. Gautam John of Karnataka Learning Partnership [5] (who participated in the above mentioned barcamp) clarified that along with continuing focus on accountability and transparency issues, evidence-driven development practices are becoming more common in India, often driven by donor conditionalities and reporting requirements.</p>
      <p>This is gradually generating a general culture of data usage within Non-Government Organisation and Civil Society Organisation spheres. It, however, may not always imply that these organisation see the data produced by them as means to (several) ends, and not only as an end product to be shared with the donor or the public in general. Furthermore, as Suman Bhattacharjea of ASER Centre [6] described, data collected by NGOs and CSOs for sharing with donors are often driven by the requirement for internationally comparable data sets, which are also sometimes produced by government agencies monitoring delivery of various services. This effectively leads to under-prioritisation of collection of data that is crucial for data/evidence-based decision making and planning at the local and regional level. Such insights were shared during the interviews often to illustrate the emerging data/evidence-based transparency research and advocacy efforts in India, and the discontents thereof. These efforts create the practical context of the “open data community” in India. The “community” struggles on one hand to address the demands for data and related skills coming from such efforts, and to envision a linked but autonomous agenda for open data in India.</p>
      <p>Nisha Thompson, one of the earliest members and currently the Director of DataMeet, narrated how the initial meetings of DataMeet, and the earlier conversations that led to DataMeet, were largely driven by individuals across organisations and with an understanding that (a) an effective engagement (and utilisation) of the issue of data, in itself, requires a lot of time, efforts and support that most organisations are not in a position to offer, and (b) the issue of transparency, understood in whichever way, is surely related to that of (government) data but there is no clear notion of what that relationship is. DataMeet, to the most extent, has been interested in addressing these concerns:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Providing a space for sharing of knowledge and practices of working with, mostly government produced, data in India among members from various (commercial and non-commercial) organisations, so as to create an extra-institutional network (from the perspective of the organisations to which the DataMeet members belong) that supports data-related activities within the network, and</li>
      <li>Exploring and pushing the connections between transparency, accountability, open data, data journalism and data-driven public discussions in India.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such a mode of functioning of DataMeet, the key open data community group in India, also implies that open data sometimes remains an agenda driven by individual members of an organisations – the members who are also associated with DataMeet – and not an organisation-wide agenda. This of course allows the organisations concerned to share learnings through the DataMeet network, but the organisation as an entirety does not become an actor in the open data community in India. Conversely, the open data agenda in India has been limited by the expanse of the DataMeet network.</p>
      <p>Suman Bhattacharjea of ASER Centre argued that many organisations that work with a large amount of government data are yet to start talking about open data as such. This, however, is not only due to the incomplete popularisation of the open data agenda but also due to longer practices of treating data as an exclusive resource to harvest insights from. Further, P.K. Bhattacharya of The Energy and Resources Institute pointed out that the lack of government-wide streamlined processes for publication of government data either for public usage or as commercial products have also led to a prominent government data re-selling industry in India. Often these data re-selling companies publish data sets that appear to have been collected by government agencies but do not come with a clear attributing notice and documentation, since the companies access these data sets through informal routes. Such practices of liberating, re-organising, and formalising government data sets accessed through informal means or in closed formats are not only limited to the data re-selling firms, but are also significantly undertaken by various research and advocacy organisations. The lack of publication of government data in open, well-documented, and regular manner not only creates the space for a data re-selling industry, but also a “closed data culture” among non-commercial re-users of data. Several research and advocacy organisations surveyed in this study have mentioned that since they undertake substantial efforts to liberate the data in the first place, they think of the sanitised data as a resource for <em>exclusive</em> internal use. This is a key challenge for the open data community in India.</p>
